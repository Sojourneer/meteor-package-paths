# Meteor Package Loader
Provides sprockets style loading of files for a Meteor package.


## Installation
Install globally so you can use the command line from any folder.

    npm install -g meteor-package-loader

## Usage
This module assumes you are structuring your package folders like this:

    /my-package
      /client
      /server
      /shared

To see the available commands, from within your package folder:

    $ package --help


To create a fresh `package.js` file with all the correct `api.add_files` entries:

    $ cd my-package
    $ package create

To update an existing `package.js` file:

    $ cd my-package
    $ package update

The resulting `package.js` files will contain the `api.add_files` listing for your package taking into account any
sprokets style comment directives you may have within any of the files.

And to update your appo's entire set of packages:

    $ cd my-app/packages
    $ package update-all

Note, calling `update-all` will not effect any packages that have been sym-linked into your app.


## Load Order

The default load order is deepest to shallowest.  Use the comment directives to override
this ordering:

    require
    require_directory (shallow)
    require_tree      (deep)

For example:

    #= require file.coffee
    #= require_tree ../dir/foo
    #= require_directory ../dir/foo

    //= require file.js
    //= require_tree ../dir/foo
    //= require_directory ../dir/foo


## Testing from the Command Line

    $ package --help

For example, from the command line:

    $ package directory ./test/simple/client

    $ package tree ./test/simple
    $ package tree ./test/directives

    $ package file ./test/simple/client/child/grand_child/grand_child.coffee
    $ package file ./test/directives/client/child/grand_child/grand_child.coffee


### Main
Files named `main` will be ordered last.


### Overrides
The execution domain (`client` / `server` / `shared`) is whatever the closest `where` name folder is.
For example, you could override the `shared` folder, declaring some `client`-only files within it like this:

    /shared
      foo.js
      /client
        css.styl
        template.html
