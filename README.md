# Meteor Package Loader
Provides sprockets style loading of files for a Meteor package.


## Installation
Install globally so you can use the command line from any folder.

  npm install -g meteor-package-loader

## Usage
This module assumes you are structuring your package folders like this:

    /my-package
      /client
      /server
      /shared

From within your package folder, generate the file listing for the `package.json` with:

    package js

This will emit the `api.add_files` listing for your package taking into account any
sprokets style comment directives you may have within any of the files.

The default load order is deepest to shallowest.  Use the comment directives to override
this ordering:

    require
    require_directory (shallow)
    require_tree      (deep)

For example:

    #= require file.coffee
    #= require_tree ../dir/foo
    #= require_directory ../dir/foo

    //= require file.js
    //= require_tree ../dir/foo
    //= require_directory ../dir/foo


## Testing from the Command Line

    $ bin/command.js --help

For example, from the command line:

    bin/command.js directory ./test/simple/client

    bin/command.js tree ./test/simple
    bin/command.js tree ./test/directives

    bin/command.js file ./test/simple/client/child/grand_child/grand_child.coffee
    bin/command.js file ./test/directives/client/child/grand_child/grand_child.coffee



## Notes
The execution domain (client/server/shared) is whatever the closest `where` name folder is.
For example, you could override the `shared` folder, placing some `client` like this:

  /shared
    foo.js
    /client
      css.styl
      template.html
