# Meteor Package Paths
Manages file paths for Meteor packages.

File inclusion is handled automatically by Meteor for `apps`. Unfortunately this is not so for packages
which have explicit file inclusion references within the `package.js` file.

This package scans the folder strucutre of your package(s) automatically updating the
file inclusion paths within your `package.js` file.

While this tool updates the `package.js` file, it is non-destructive and only changes
the file path references, leaving all other lines within `package.js` intact.

Along with emulating the default Meteor file load order rules, this package
provides [sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets) style overriding
of the load order of files within the `package.js` file.  This can be particularly
useful in the odd occasion where you really need one JS file to exist in the environment
prior to another - and you don't wish to pervert your naming or folder structure
to achieve that.




## Installation
Install globally so you can use the command line from any folder.

    npm install -g meteor-package-paths

## Usage
This module assumes you are structuring your package folders like this:

    /my-package
      /client
      /server
      /shared
      /images

To see the available commands, from within your package folder:

    $ package --help


To create a fresh `package.js` file with all the correct `api.addFiles` entries:

    $ cd my-package
    $ package create 'My Package'

To update an existing `package.js` file:

    $ cd my-package
    $ package update

The resulting `package.js` file will contain the `api.addFiles` listing for your package taking into account any
sprokets style comment directives you may have within any of the files.

And to update your app's entire set of packages:

    $ cd my-app/packages
    $ package update-all

Note, calling `update-all` will not effect any packages that have been sym-linked into your app.


## Load Order

#### Path Directives
The default load order is deepest to shallowest.  Use the comment directives to override
this ordering:

    require
    require_directory (shallow)
    require_tree      (deep)

For example:

    #= require file.coffee
    #= require_tree ../dir/foo
    #= require_directory ../dir/foo

    //= require file.js
    //= require_tree ../dir/foo
    //= require_directory ../dir/foo

#### Base directives
Files containing the `base` directive are ordered first, shallowest to deepest.  This is a
reversal of the above rules and is useful for the common pattern of having base classes
declared in parent folders, under which folders contianing the files of deriving classes reside.

    #= base
    //= base

#### Exclusions
To exclude a file:

    #= exclude


#### Exclusions
Images can be placed anywhere within the folder structure, and they are only added
to the `client`.  By convention, images are typically stored under:

    /my-package
      /images



## Testing from the Command Line

    $ package --help

For example, from the command line:

    $ package directory ./test/simple/client

    $ package tree ./test/simple
    $ package tree ./test/directives

    $ package file ./test/simple/client/child/grand_child/grand_child.coffee
    $ package file ./test/directives/client/child/grand_child/grand_child.coffee


#### Main
Files named `main` will be ordered last, deepest to shallowest.


#### 'Where' Overrides
The execution domain (`client` / `server` / `shared`) is whatever the closest `where` name folder is.
For example, you could override the `shared` folder, declaring some `client`-only files within it like this:

    /shared
      foo.js
      /client
        css.styl
        template.html


#### Package tests
Use the same `client` / `server` / `shared` folder structure within a `tests` directory
to have the test files output within the package's `Package.on_test` declaration block.
